Raspberry Pi
Zbar is installed
	- Need camera installed to test
MPU6050 detects orientation
 	- (especially changes in degree over short periods of time)
	- Upgrade to MPU9250
	- Work on detect directional acceleration with accelerometer
		(Easier with MPU9250)
	

Arduino
Ultrasonic sensors up and running
	- Detect distance
Laser/photocell?


Plan:
1. Output motors so that the robot moves forward
	a. Keep track of gyroscope data, if significant change,
	   correct.
	b. Keep track of L, F, R ultrasonic sensors.
		i. If L/R are close, adjust motors so they move away
		ii. If F is close, navigate left or right 90 degrees
		    (What direction should we go next time F is close?)
		iii. For 90 degree turn, use gyroscope, setting 
		     temporary reference value and turning until 
		     the displacement is 90 degrees
2. Read data from Raspberry Pi camera
	a. If QR code sensed, stop reading from Pi camera for x seconds
	b. Translate first 4 binary digits of string into a number 0-15
	c. Look up that 0-15 in memory to get actual room #
	d. If incorrect, continue moving and turn Pi camera back on
	e. If correct, translate last 4 binary digits, considering
	   each digit individually
3. Look up how to use motors for each of 4 digit possibilties
	- For 90 degree turn, use gyroscope, setting temporary
	  reference value and turning until the displacement is 90
	  degrees

Running at all times:
1. Ultrasonic sensors are priority
	- Don't run into anything
2. Raspberry Pi camera
	- These are the end goals
	- ** Turns off for a short period after reading a QR code 
	  so that it doesn't read it again
3. Gyroscope
	- Measure the turn of the robot
4. Motors
	- Output almost continuously, stopping only when the right
	  QR code is found, then different maneuvers are made to
	  guide the robot through the door
